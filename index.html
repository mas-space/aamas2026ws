            <p>This workshop aims at disseminating and sharing recent advances in the use of agent-based and
                multi-agent-based models and techniques in the Space domain. Indeed, the use of agent-based and
                multi-agent systems (MAS) in aerospace and space is gaining traction, as they offer a promising approach
                for modeling and solving distributed, complex and dynamic problems. Sample applications notably include
                multiple spacecraft operations and maintenance, onboard-ground coordination, mission simulation,
                multi-mission operation, autonomous navigation, and collective robotics.</p>
            <p> AAMAS-related areas such as Engineering Multiagent Systems, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and
                Planning, Markets, Auctions, and Non-Cooperative Game Theory or Modelling and Simulation of Societies,
                develop relevant models and techniques to address such Space-related applications.</p>
            <!--p>Some topics that will be discussed during the workshops are:
            <ul>
            <li>Coordination, Organisations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics, for devising organisational models of more and more complex Space system of systems;
            <li>Engineering Multiagent Systems, for providing tools for programming agents in this context;
            <li>Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and Planning, for providing methods to efficiently plan spacecraft and space assets activities;
            <li>Learning and Adaptation, for enabling assets to adapt to the high dynamic nature of the Space systems;
            <li>Markets, Auctions, and Non-Cooperative Game Theory, for providing tools to coordinate activities in market-based Newspace;
            <li>Modeling and Simulation of Societies, for assessing behavior and performance of systems to be deployed;
            <li>Social Choice and Cooperative Game Theory, for coordinating resource usage in more and more shared environments.

                    <p>
                        The workshop on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems for Space Applications (MASSpace) aims
                        to be a multidisciplinary meeting place to discuss the contributions of <b>autonomous agents and
                        multi-agent systems to the space domain</b>. In deed, the Space domain is moving fast, and
                        recent evolution tends to consider more and more complex and composite systems (e.g. larger
                        constellations, multiple-mission federations, multi-user systems, heterogenous robotic systems),
                        with stronger expectations, notably to perform more and more accurate environmental monitoring,
                        complex requests, or richer exploration scenarios. In such context, agent-based and multi-agent
                        systems appear to provide relevant paradigms to answer to these expectations. </p>
                    <p>In recent years, several papers applying AAMAS models and techniques to Space domain have been
                        published in AAMAS and other venues which strongly advocates for organizing an event on the
                        cross-fertilization of AAMAS and Space, as (i) to provide Space domain experts with the means to
                        use these multi-agent models and techniques, and (ii) to challenge multi-agents models and
                        techniques with novel problems coming from the Space domain. Thus, any AAMAS attendee could find
                        interest in participating to the workshop, due to the broad scope of relevant AAMAS-related
                        topics.

                    <p>Since the early years of AAMAS, Space have been identified as a very relevant and challenging

                        their environment (e.g. NewSpace), all AAMAS topics and techniques (see <a
